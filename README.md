# Heterogenous-Ship-Data
Remote sensing images for ship classification :
The proposed Heterogeneous Ship data is comprised of three classes: OPTICAL SHIP, SAR SHIP, and NO SHIP. The dataset contains 4,630 images. A total of 2,811 SAR images of ships and no-ship instances were sourced online from the ”multi-source and multi-scale SAR ship slice dataset”. The SAR images in the dataset are from Gaofen-3 and Sentinel-1. Gaofen-3 image resolutions are 3, 5, 8, and 10 meters, with ultrafine strip-maps (UFS), fine strip-map 1 (FSI), full polarization 1 (QPSI), full polarization 2 (QPSII), and fine strip-map 2 (FSII) imaging modes, respectively. The S3 strip map (SM), S6 SM, and IW-mod are the imaging modes of Sentinel-1. A total number of 1819 optical satellite images were sourced from the Airbus Ship Detection dataset, which contained more than one hundred thousand satellite images describing only two classes; images with ships and images without ships. This dataset is widely known as a better option for imbalanced scenarios during deep learning ship training.
